Hey everybody, I'm working on a new series where I deploy a small project that uses a
FastAPI server on a raspberry pi 4 in my home network.

It will feature the stack of:

- FastAPI using external services
- Deployment in Dokku, probably with some nginx
- Setting up the Pi 4 to be accessible from the web
- Setting up my domain on strato.com to direct to the Pi

Stay tuned!
