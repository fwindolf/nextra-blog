## What's SOLID?

The SOLID Principles are five principles of object oriented class design, that try to
help programmers when write clean code.

Copied straight from Wikipedia, the principles are:

- The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
- The Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
- The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
- The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
- The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretes."

They are also often brought up in the same context as Clean Code and were introduced by
the same guy (Robert Martin), but came a bit earlier. The acronym SOLID has been coined by
Michael Feathers though.

SOLID and Clean Code aim for the same goals

- Keep the codebase maintainable
- Reduce the number of bugs
- Facilitate collaboration

but the latter concentrates a bit more on the craftmanship, while SOLID offers the
underlying principles. Small focussed functions as a practice for example help adhere
to the Single Responsibility principle.

### Single Responsibility

As I understand it, the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should
only have a single purpose. As this is quite hard to scope, the single reason to change
is a good proxy.
Applying the principle will lead to small entitites that are cohesive and very focussed
on solving an actual problem. When the scope of a class grows, it becomes harder to
track down side effects, have an overview of all the usages up to a worst case where it
gets impossible to keep the full functionality in a mental model at a time.

### Open-Closed Principle

The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) is a complicated way of saying a very obvious thing: If
everybody that needs to add to a certain entity needs to change it, every change will be
hard. In my understanding, it urges you to write code that is extensible by allowing
specialization and/or extension, but restricts others from modyfing things.
Every modification of the original could lead to unintended side effects, making
seemingly easy changes turn into a rabbit hole. Every extension or specialization leaves
the original code untouched, therefore being easier to work with and less risky.

### Liskov Substitution

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ensures that each child class can replace its
parent class. In other words, if you implement an interface it should be done in a way
that all implementations keep the "contract" that is established by the interface and/or
base implementation. In modern OOP this is somewhat of a no-brainer, as there are usually
language features and/or libraries that allow to enforce such a contract (eg. Protocols,
ABC in python).

### Interface Segregation

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) extends the single responsibility principle
by stating that interfaces should be tailored to the relevant use case. It basically
shows the option of splitting interfaces into several complementary interfaces tailored
to a single use, instead of packing everything into one big interface where some
users only implement a small subset of the defined methods.
Similar to the SRP, smaller and cohesive interfaces are then easier to maintain,
implement and understand.

### Dependency Inversion

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that modules should only be coupled
via abstractions. With dependency injection becoming more prominent, the principle
should be quite well known - albeit maybe not by that name. Instead of interacting
with low level components of another domain or module, extract the functionality into
an interface and use that interface everywhere. This promotes low coupling between
systems and makes the code a bit more flexible.


## What's YAGNI?

Now that we know the 5 principles of SOLID, let's go more towards my opinion towards
the topic.

### You're Not Gonna Need It!

We as developers are very bad at estimating the changes that will be made to the
software that we write in the future. Hitting that same note, YAGNI tries to save you
from thinking to much about the what-ifs of your code.
You're not going to need that different database, the different IO logic, etc. I think
I have never been 100% right about how the code will change in the future, so every
attempt that I've made to predict where I would maybe need that interface was at least
partially incorrect.
All that happened was that I took almost the same time rewriting the interface that I
needed to put the interface in place in the first place. So instead of planning ahead,
I will build for what I need right now and what I know for sure at the time when
building.

## What To Take From This Article

But of course, it's not black and white. I have gone overboard with following SOLID
principles, clean code, etc. in some projects, and have suffered from not follwoing the
principles enough in others.

### Size and Scope matter

Every project is different, and not all projects become big. Building a small solo-project
with all the flexibility and abstraction you can get might be a nice exercise but will
slow you down immensely, as most of your time is spent writing the abstraction and not
the actual logic. For those kind of projects I try to be very pragmatic and build up as
I go. Most end up at the side of the road to be forever ignored anyways, and the ones
that grow will get some refactoring here and there to add the interfaces that are
necessary.

For big work projects, the approach is different as well. You mostly sit down and think/
talk architecture, domains, etc. This naturally leads to more abstraction from the get
go, and modules that are touched/maintained by different people only interact well via
very strict and static contracts. Also, the code that someone else wrote is naturally
harder to understand than your own, so a bit more focus on simplicity, single
responsibility and cohesion is necessary.

### Locality of Code

Another aspect of SOLID is that if you follow it to the extent that most tutorials
propose, you will end up with what was previously a 30-line functions scattered around
across different interfaces, implementations in different files, etc.

While this improves maintainability of each single part, it makes the functionality
much harder to understand. It's not immediately obvious from looking at 30 lines, instead
you have to keep the different partsin a mental model, which is harder.
The bigger the functionality, the harder that becomes.

So in my opinion, it's actually not
always a good idea to abstract all different parts of that functionality, even if they
are not 100% the same responsibility. Being able to visually see the complete
implementation is an underrated aspect, especially for smaller projects.

### Perfect Is The Enemy Of Done

The last point to keep in mind when programming to me is: Perfect is the enemy of done.
Sure, you can strive for the perfect interfaces, the perfect implementation and the
100% test coverage to ensure everything works. In my experience however, trying to
actually going for the 100% from the start will slow you down immensely.

The goal of SOLID, clean code, etc is to make your life easier and to help you guide to
being a better programmer. It offers you tools and concepts that help to not fall into
the same holes that thousands before you have. But the other big trap that I came
across in programming is the thinking that the first throw has to be perfect or as close
to perfect as possible given the limited knowledge you have. It does not. Starting out
small and going until you need abstractions is a perfectly suitable way in many
projects. For the decision when, what and how to abstract you can fall back to SOLID
and Clean Code.

## Conclusion

In this article I tried to share my philosophy to writing code. But as always, it's
a learning journey and experiences from only a few hands full of projects.

What prompted this article was post about how following SOLID made a project go perfect
on LinkedIn. While this might be true, my experience has been slightly different so I
decided to share it.

To summarize, I'd go from a Miles Davis quote:

> Learn the score, then throw it away

While not fully true, having learned the SOLID principles is a very good thing. It gives
you perspective on concepts like cohesion, coherence, coupling, well maintainable code
and a few more.

Building your software with those principles in mind will always make it better.
Building your software around those principles will not, which is a mistake I have seen
and made multiple times.

So my key learnings would be:

- Build interfaces when you need them, not when you think you might need them
- Keep your modules seperate and behind smallish interfaces, but keep locality of code
in mind for within modules.
- There is no shame in refactoring, even early in a project. This is the price you pay
for not getting it perfect from the start, and done is better than perfect.
