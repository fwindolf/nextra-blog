## What We Will Achieve

- **Install Dokku:** We install dokku and setup docker to use the SSD for storing containers
- **Global Setup:** We configure the domain and generate SSH keys with which we can deploy
- **Let's Encrypt:** We setup the let's encrypt plugin so we can later enable HTTPS

## Installing Dokku on the Pi 4

After using our existing setup from the [first post in this series](2024-03-17-local-setup)
to ssh into our Pi, we can install dokku by running the super convenient setup script:

```bash
wget -NP . https://dokku.com/install/v0.33.6/bootstrap.sh
sudo DOKKU_TAG=v0.33.6 bash bootstrap.sh
```

## Move Docker to SSD

Since the SD Card that I put the OS on is only 32GB big, but I want to deploy multiple
services on the Pi with some spare room for data storage, I added a SSD hat to the Pi.

This however means, that all storage and docker containers need to be put on that SSD
to begin with. To do this, I simply ran those few commands:

- Stop docker: `service docker stop`.
- Verify no docker process is running anymore `ps faux | grep docker`
- Take a look at the current docker directory: `ls /var/lib/docker/`
- Make a backup of the existing docker directory `tar -zcC /var/lib docker > /mnt/ssd/var_lib_docker-backup-$(date +%s).tar.gz`
- Move the `/var/lib/docker` directory to the new partition: `mv /var/lib/docker /mnt/ssd/docker`
- Make a symlink: `ln -s /mnt/pd0/docker /var/lib/docker` to replace the old docker directory
- Verify everything looks like before `ls /var/lib/docker/` (note the trailing slash to resolve the symlink)
- Start docker back up `service docker start`

With that, we're ready to put some containers in place.

## Dokku

Now let's get to the fun part: [Dokku](https://dokku.com/).

Dokku calls itself "The smallest PaaS implementation you've ever seen". PaaS as in "platform"
as a service. If you've worked in the web development space, you might have come across heroku
as a common way to quickly deploy things. It's beauty lies in the ease of use, where a simple
`app.json` together with a `package.json` are enough to deploy a web application, and many
other types of applications aswell.

Dokku offers the same value, but in a self-hosted way. It became popular at the time where
heroku killed its free tier a few years ago. Using a dokku installation on the remote
server, you can very easily setup new *apps*, integrate their deployment into common CI
workflows, manage the deployment, etc. It comes with reverse proxy built-in and offers
plugin support to easily get HTTPS/SSL set up using letsencrypt.

### Global Setup

We start out with doing the global setup:

First we add our global domain.

```bash
dokku domains:add-global fwindolf.dev
dokku domains:report --global
```
The latter command will show you the current setup. Leaving out the `--global` flag
tells you that there is no application deployed yet. We will add one later.

We also enable nginx as our proxy using this command.

```bash
dokku proxy:set --global nginx
```

### Deploy Keys

But before that, we need to setup an SSH key for the deployment. There are multiple ways to deploy
an application, but the most prominent is to use an alternative git remote to push to.
On push, dokku will then (re-)build the application and (re-)deploy it.

I will show you how to setup github CI/CD to take over that job on a push in [another
tutorial](2024-03-21-automatic-deployment).

First, on the host (locally, where you develop), we want to generate a new SSH key for
the deployments.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh/dokku/
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N "" -C "deploy@fwindolf.dev" -f ~/.ssh/dokku/deploy
```

Now we need to copy the public key and add it to the dokku ssh keys. For that, on the
local machine I ran the following command and copied the output to clipboard.

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/dokku/deploy.pub
```

After sshing into the Pi (remote, where we want to deploy), we add it via this command.

```bash
echo "<content>" | sudo dokku ssh-keys:add DEPLOY
```

If the output is the checksum, everything is fine. We now can add a ssh config option
to automatically use this ssh key when pushing to the remote.


### LetsEncript Setup

To eventually get rid of the warning in browsers when accessing the website we need to enable
HTTPS. The easiest way of acquiring a certificate for that is to use letsencrypt.

letsencrypt is a open certificate authority that hands out SSL/TLS certificates for
free on proof of ownership of a domain. In short, you solve a challenge and report the
result back from the domain that is requesting a certificate, and letsencrypt issues
the certificate.

For dokku, there is a plugin that does just that, helping with everything from providing
the logic to solve the challenge to configuring nginx to allow letsencrypt retrieve the
result. We simply installed it via

```bash
sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt.git
```

Now everything that's left to do when we want to use it is to setup the configuration
with our email and enable letsencrypt.

```bash
dokku domains:add <app> <subdomain>.fwindolf.dev
dokku letsencrypt:enable <app>
```

If needed, the plugin will also auto-renew the certificate once it expires.

```
dokku letsencrypt:cron-job --add
```
