import Image from 'next/image';

## What We Will Achieve

- **Write The App**: We create a "Hello World" FastAPI application
- **App Configuration**: We setup the used ports, proxy settings and environment variables with dokku
- **HTTPS Setup**: We get certificates for our app and make it accessible from the web

## Check Current Setup

To start off and check that everything we did so far works, we us dnslookup again to
check if the DNS entries for our domain route to cloudflare or the publicly exposed
router depending on the setup.

If that works and we can ping our website, we try curl.

```bash
ping fwindolf.dev
curl fwindolf.dev
```

The curl should respond with a "Welcome to nginx!" message, while if we type our URL
into the browser, this page should appear:

<Image src="/images/blog/2024-03-19/cloudflare_error.png" alt="Cloudflare Web Server Is Down Message" width={1000} height={500} />

This is expected, as we don't have any application running yet.

## Minimal FastAPI Application

To have a deployable application, we will just a very basic FastAPI example, which can
be found [here](https://github.com/fwindolf/fastapi-minimal.git).

### Structure

The application does not do much, but is enough to show the things necessary to get started with a dokku application. It consists of:

- The application logic as
    - the source code in `api/`, with `app.py` as the entrypoint
    - some integration tests in `test/integration/`
    - the environment in `.env` to be copied from `.env.example`
- Everything needed for deployment as
    - a `pyproject.toml` and the associated `poetry.lock` file that freezes the dependencies
    - the `Dockerfile` and the `.dockerignore` to build a container
    - an `app.json` file for some extra information for dokku


We have three + one routes available:

1. The home route (`/`) that shows a hello world message
2. The `/health` route that provides a healthcheck to see if the container is running
3. The `/v1/protected` route to mimick some logic behind a (very minimal) auth layer
4. The `/docs` route provided by FastAPI with the API documentation.

<Image src="/images/blog/2024-03-19/fastapi_docs.png" alt="Application Docs Page" width={1000} height={500} />

### Application Logic

As already stated, the application doesn't offer much in this state.

The `app.py` entrypoint wraps our `FastAPI` application into gunicorn, which provides the sauce for speedy and low resource workers for basically any modern web framework.

```python
import uvicorn

from api import app

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```


The `api.app` is just the `FastAPI` instance, with two registered routers that handle
the home and the protected routes.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

from api.home import router as home_router
from api.v1.protected import router as protected_router

app = FastAPI()

app.include_router(home_router, tags=["Home"])
app.include_router(protected_router, prefix="/v1", tags=["V1"])
```

In the home, we have two functions that specify the routes, one for the `/` and one for the `/health` routes. Both of them return simple json.

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()


@router.get("/")
async def home():
    return {"message": "Hello World!"}


@router.get("/health")
async def healthcheck():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

For the protected route, we first specified some settings in `api.settings` using `pydantic_settings`, which loads the members from the environment variables (but can be configured to do much more than that).

```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    api_key: str


settings = Settings()
```

Those settings are used in the `api.auth` to provide a helper to check if an `x-api-key` header is present. This is not a good choice for production use, but it brings across the point for this tutorial.

```python
from fastapi import HTTPException, Security
from fastapi.security import api_key

from api.settings import settings

api_key_header = api_key.APIKeyHeader(name="X-API-KEY")


async def validate_api_key(key: str = Security(api_key_header)):
    if key != settings.api_key:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid or missing Api Key")

    return None
```

Finally, we use this method to check for authentication in the route handler for the
protected route `/protected` by specifying it as a dependency for the router.

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends

from api import auth

router = APIRouter(dependencies=[Depends(auth.validate_api_key)])


@router.get("/protected")
async def secret():
    return {"message": "This is some protected information"}
```

### Deployment

All of that is packaged into a Dockerfile, based on a python base image.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim as base

ARG POETRY_VERSION=1.5.1

ENV APP_DIR='/opt/app'

ENV PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1 \
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PYTHONHASHSEED=random \
    PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=off \
    PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=on \
    PIP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=100 \
    # Poetry
    POETRY_HOME='/opt/poetry' \
    POETRY_NO_INTERACTION=1 \
    POETRY_VERSION=${POETRY_VERSION} \
    POETRY_CACHE_DIR='/opt/.cache/pypoetry' \
    POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT=true

# System dependencies
RUN apt-get -qy update \
    && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y curl build-essential gcc ffmpeg \
    && curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - \
    && apt-get remove -y curl build-essential \
    && apt-get autoremove --purge -y \
    && apt-get autoclean -y \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/apt/* /var/lib/apt/lists/*

ENV PATH="${POETRY_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"

RUN mkdir -p ${APP_DIR}
WORKDIR ${APP_DIR}

COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ${APP_DIR}/

RUN poetry --version \
    && poetry install --no-ansi --no-root --without dev -v \
    && rm -rf ${POETRY_CACHE_DIR} \
    && poetry env info --path

ENV PATH="${VIRTUAL_ENV}:${VIRTUAL_ENV}/bin:${PATH}"

COPY . ${APP_DIR}
WORKDIR ${APP_DIR}

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["poetry", "run", "uvicorn", "api:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

In that we do the following:

1. We setup the environment for Python, Pip and Poetry
2. We install the dependencies needed to get the Poetry installation script, install
poetry, and remove the added dependencies again to keep the image small.
2. Then we expose `poetry` in the path and switch to our application directory.
3. We copy over only the `pyproject.toml` and the `poetry.lock` file to make use of
caching for the `poetry install` later
4. We install the virtual environment, we previously set it up to land in the project
(`.venv` folder)
5. We expose the installed binaries (like `uvicorn`, etc) in the path
6. We copy the rest of the application that's not ignored by `.dockerignore`
7. We set the entrypoint to what we need to run the app. Note the `0.0.0.0` allows
access from outside the container.

As dokku tries to not only build this image later, but also needs to deploy it, we also
add some extra information in `app.json`. In there you can find among other things
the healthcheck route to see if the container is running, which allows dokku to change
from an old to the newly deployed version without any downtime, aswell as the needed
environment variables for the deployment.

## Create the Dokku App

Now that everything is ready and we have a running application, we need to deploy it on
dokku. For that we run the following commands on the Pi.

```bash
dokku apps:create fastapi
dokku domains:set fastapi fastapi.fwindolf.dev
dokku apps:report
```

This results in an overview of the newly created application.

```
dokku apps:report
=====> fastapi app information
    App created at:                1710778681
    App deploy source:
    App deploy source metadata:
    App dir:                       /home/dokku/fastapi
    App locked:                    false
```

### Deployment

To deploy there is two ways:

1. We add our dokku as an alternative remote url for git (The URL that specifies where
your repository lives, for example on `github.com/<your-name>/<your-repository-name>`)
and then we can simply push to it.
2. We use a container repository and specify the built docker image directly. We will
not do this as I find the other way much more convenient, but if your application
container is built in CI/CD anyways this would be the better choice.


Before we can initialize the git deploy, we make sure again that the ssh config is
correct. Make sure you already have a `~/.ssh/config` setup as we did in the last
tutorial and your ssh public key exists already on the Pi. For me, the entry looks
like this:

```
Host <IP of the Pi>
    User            dokku
    IdentityFile    /home/flo/.ssh/dokku/deploy
```

The IP could be both the Pi's IP in the home network as well as the one that you put
into the A record in your Cloudflare settings. If you're using DynDNS, this should
be the IP in the home network, as the public IP is subject to change. I didn't get
it to work with the domain name, I assume it's because Cloudflare prohibits SSH via
domain name.

Now on the Pi, we run those commands:

```bash
dokku git:initialize fastapi
dokku git:set --global deploy-branch main
```

The latter is probably not necessary, but better safe than sorry. Now we have set up
dokku to automatically use a pre-recieve hook when we push to the dokku remote that
builds the `main` branch of our application with the associated builder. The builder
in our case is docker, which dokku determines automatically because we have a
`Dockerfile` in our repository. We could also use
[another builder](https://dokku.com/docs/deployment/builders/builder-management/),
but I'm just used to docker.

Before we can execute the deployment, we still have to specify the environment
variables necessary to successfully launch the container. For that we run this
command on the Pi.

```bash
dokku config:set fastapi API_KEY=1234
```

You could also add a `--no-restart`  flag to it to avoid a restart, but as there is no
active deployment there is also nothing to be restarted yet anyways.

Now finally, we can add the remote url on your local machine (not the Pi!) by executing
those commands.

```bash
git remote add dokku dokku@<IP of the Pi>:fastapi
git push dokku main
```

Note that this push does not push your changes to github, so it's a good idea to still
do that once in a while to store your code safely.

The latter command will trigger the build and the deployment of the current state on
your main branch. I was greeted with this message, let's unpick it:

This chunk of logs indicates all the steps that docker went through to build the final
image, which now lives on our Pi as `fastapi:latest`.

```
-----> Releasing fastapi...

-----> Checking for release task

```

The next lines are empty as we don't have any tasks for the deployment setup and also
there was no previous deployment.

```
=====> Processing deployment checks

       Healthcheck succeeded name='port listening check'
       Healthcheck succeeded name='healthcheck'
       All checks successful (web.1)
```

The next block deploys the image and waits until the container is up, as indicated by
the healthcheck that first fails and then succeeds.

```
=====> Start of fastapi container output (web.1)
       INFO:     Started server process [7]
       INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
       INFO:     Application startup complete.

       INFO:     172.17.0.1:41380 - "GET /health HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
=====> End of fastapi container output (web.1)
```

This shows us the output of the container that was started, which looks good. You can
also see the second (succeeding) healthcheck that shows up in the logs.

```
=====> Triggering early nginx proxy rebuild

-----> Running post-deploy

-----> Ensuring network configuration is in sync for fastapi
-----> Configuring fastapi.fwindolf.dev...(using built-in template)
-----> Creating http nginx.conf
       Reloading nginx
```

The nginx config is now built based on the configuration that we set up. We did not yet
set that up, so the basic configuration is built.

In general, dokku uses a `.sigil` template to generate the configuration for each
application based on the configuration (which ports to use, if SSL is enabled, etc).
It mostly does everything out of the box, but we could also add a `nginx.conf.sigil`
to our application to change the default behaviour. More information on that can be
found [here](https://dokku.com/docs/networking/proxies/nginx/#customizing-the-nginx-configuration).

```
-----> Renaming containers
       Renaming container fastapi.web.1.upcoming-15327 (827d5b3f3307) to fastapi.web.1
-----> Checking for postdeploy task
       No postdeploy task found, skipping
=====> Application deployed:
       http://fastapi.fwindolf.dev:8000
```

In the last step, it would exchange the deployments and then destroy the old one, after
which the newly built deployment is visible to the user.

### Configuration

#### CNAME Record

If not already happened, we no can go to our Cloudflare Dashboard and add a new CNAME
entry for `fastapi` for the domain, in my case `fwindolf.dev`. Note that this can take
some time to propagate, so if a curl comes back with `Could not resolve host: ...`, just
wait a few hours and try again.

```bash
curl http://fastapi.fwindolf.dev
```

#### Ports Mapping

However, the above url is still not reaching our API. The reason is that dokku does not
know how to handle the incoming HTTP traffic on port 80 (default HTTP). We still have
to set up a port mapping on the Pi.

```bash
dokku ports:list fastapi
```

Outputs a underwhelming `No port mappings configured for app` message. So we run a

```bash
dokku ports:set fastapi http:80:8000
```

to map the incoming HTTP Port on 80 to the port our `fastapi` application uses. Now the
above curl should return the following:

```json
{"message": "Hello World!"}
```


### HTTPS with Let's Encrypt

Typing the url into your browser however will warn you that this page is not safe and
will decide to save you from great evil. To avoid that, we need to set up SSL/TLS to
allow communication to our server via HTTPS.

Big corporations have own costly certificates for that, but we are more than happy with
the certs that [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) provides us with. In the
last tutorial, we have already installed the plugin and we should be ready to go now.
So we simply use the plugin to get us the certs.

```bash
dokku letsencrypt:set fastapi email "florianwindolf@gmail.com"
dokku letsencrypt:enable fastapi
```

```

```

This output nicely shows you what happens behind the curtains.

- The ACME proxy is added to our nginx config, which allows let's encrypt to access the
results of the challenge
- We generate cert keys locally corresponding to our email
- Then we hit the let's encrypt endpoint that gives us the challenge
- The challenge HTTP-01 is solved using a docker-container that we pulled when
installing the plugin
- The results are placed in the expected folder
- Let's encrypt fetches the results from our Pi and responds with the certificates
- We save the certificates and rebuild nginx.conf to remove the ACME proxy and enable
HTTPS

We can validate this works by looking at the report:

```
dokku letsencrypt:report fastapi
=====> fastapi letsencrypt information
    Letsencrypt active:            true
    Letsencrypt autorenew:         false

    Letsencrypt global server:
    Letsencrypt server:
```

If you want, you can now enable the re-generation of the certificates with a cron job in
the plugin. This is generally a good idea, then you don't have to think about renewing
the certificates every two months (For me a auto-renew command responds with "fastapi
still has 59d, 22h, 52m, 53s left before renewal").

```bash
dokku letsencrypt:cron-job --add
sudo -H -u dokku crontab -l
```

The output should be something like

```
-----> Added cron job to dokku's crontab.
```

and

```
@daily /var/lib/dokku/plugins/available/letsencrypt/cron-job
```

This means that every day, the let's encrypt plugin will try to renew our certificates.

## Validation

With that setup, we should now no longer be able to curl the HTTP endpoint. The response
is an nginx error page that tells us the http endpoint is being permanently redirected.

```bash
curl fastapi.fwindolf.dev
```

```html
<html>
<head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx</center>
</body>
</html>
```

With the HTTPS endpoint, we should however get the hello world response.

```bash
curl https://fastapi.fwindolf.dev
```

We should also be able to see it directly in the browser.

This means our application is now deployed, and we can try to access the secret.

To still reach the API, we go back to curl and add a header:

```bash
curl https://fastapi.fwindolf.dev/v1/protected -H "x-api-key: 1234"
```

The result is the expected

```json
{"message":"This is some protected information"}
```

## Troubleshooting

Dokku offers some way to take a look into the container and the nginx.

### Container Logs

The overall container logs can be viewed via this command.

```bash
dokku logs fastapi
```

It spills all the logs, so you can easily see what endpoints have been called.

### Nginx logs

If you don't see expected calls showing up in the container logs, the next thing to
 search is the nginx access logs.

```bash
dokku nginx:access-logs fastapi
```

Here you see all calls that have been forwarded to your application by nginx. This will
contain quite some clutter as every endpoint that's visible to the web will be visited
by many different crawlers and bots as soon as it has a DNS record.

If that doesn't help you, you can also take a look at the nginx error logs.

```bash
dokku nginx:error-logs fastapi
```

This will contain all the errors that nginx encountered, for example if it couldn't
start up or stopped unexpectedly. Also all potentially problematic calls will be
logged here.
