## What We Will Achieve

- **Raspberry Pi Setup:** We start with a fresh Pi and set it up so we can ssh into it
- **Network Configuration:** We setup the network for SSHing into the Pi
- **Security Measures:** We create a keypair to make it easy and secure to ssh into the Pi
- **Port Forwarding:** We setup port forwarding on the router to allow accessing ssh and other things from everywhere
- **DNS Setup:** We provide a domain name for the IP of the Pi to expose it to the internet
- **Validation:** We make sure everything works correctly. This took me about a week because I had no clue :)


## Installation

Starting with the fresh Raspberry Pi 4, I downloaded and created a bootable SD card using the Raspbian image,
although you could opt for another OS (Ubuntu, etc. Note that some might require additional configuration for SSH).
I used the Raspberry Pi Imager to flash the image onto the SD card (it allows to pre-configure network settings
and SSH access among other things).

## First Connection

With the Pi hooked up to my router via cable, I could easily locate it in the Network tab of my router.
First thing I did was assigning it a static IP, so I can always reach it via the same IP in my network.

To setup proper SSH access, I then SSHd into the Pi using username and the IP, which worked out of the box.

For other OS, you might first have to hook up a keyboard and monitor to install the openssh-server, configure
it to allow SSH access and then you can login via ssh.

Connecting from my host machine, I first generated new SSH keys (or you could use existing ones):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f /home/flo/.ssh/pi/id_ed25519
```

Then, I copied the SSH key to the Pi using:
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i /home/flo/.ssh/pi/id_ed25519.pub flo@192.168.178.100
```

(specifying my password) which allows me to login with the key from now on.

I also set up an entry in my SSH config file for easy access:

```bash
code ~/.ssh/config
```

Adding:
```
Host pi
    HostName        192.168.178.100
    User            flori
    IdentityFile    /home/flo/.ssh/pi/id_ed25519
```

Now, I can simply use `ssh pi` to log in. As I later also wanted to expose SSH to the
web, I also disabled the password authentication for ssh and only allow ssh key
authentication by changing the settings for the ssh server via `etc/ssh/sshd_config`


```
...
PasswordAuthentication no
UsePAM no
...
PubkeyAuthentication yes
```

Then restarting the ssh server via `service ssh restart` to apply the changes, only key based logins are possible.

# Fritz!Box DNS Setup

Now let's make the Pi accessible from the web. For this I again visited my routers configuration
interface and first setup port forwarding for SSH, which we later extend to HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

I first tried to setup DNS via DynDNS and Strato, which failed. Later I switched to MyFritz! and CloudflareDNS
which worked really well. Note that for this, you first have to setup a MyFritz! account that
gives your Fritz!Box a static IP, which you can then use later to setup the DNS.

## Port Forwarding (SSH)

But first things first. I wanted to be able to SSH into my Pi from wherever I am (to restart
containers, fix stuff, etc.). Note that there are security implications, anyone who accesss
the Pi can probably do a lot of harm to your local network and it's a security risks for ALL
the devices in the home network. So login based SSH connections are a really bad idea!

To set up the port forwarding, I did those things:

1. Navigate to Internet > Forwarding > Portforwarding > Add Device and then select your Pi in the dropdown.
2. Enable 'Release PING6' and 'Open firewall for delegated IPv6 prefixes of this device.'
3. Do not set is as an Exposed Host (except maaaaaybe for testing, but I wouldn't recommend that either).

Then, set up a new share for SSH:

- Application: Other Application
- Description: SSH
- Protocol: TCP
- Port: 22
- Enable the forwarding.

If you already setup MyFritz, you can also directly use MyFritz instead of making it a normal
port forwarding rule - the UI is just slightly different.

## Validation

Before we start, let's go over how to validate things quickly.

To confirm everything is set up correctly:

- Use tools like [nslookup.io](https://www.nslookup.io/) to check DNS propagation.
- If port forwarding is enabled, test the SSH connection with `ssh [username]@[ip]`.

Note: that SSH via the domain never worked for me, I was just always using the IP that
I got from MyFritz or which was shown in the Internet tab in the router.

## Setup

Another small thing to check off is the concepts. This was not 100% clear to me when I
started, so I just leave this bit of information here:

- *DNS (Domain Name System)* is the system behind translateing domain names to IP addresses so for example
browsers can access them. It's basically a distributed set of records/database where you can find information like IP addresses for domains. The distributed nature is why it can take a while between setting up a DNS record and the browser
being able to resolve it - also depending on where on the world you're at.
- *A* Record points a domain to an IPv4 address. This is how the domain is resolved to an IPv4 address, eg when you ping it.
- *AAAA* Record links a domain to an IPv6 address. Same here.
- *CNAME* (Canonical Name) aliases a domain to another domain. This is what you use for subdomains on your domain, eg. for foo.example.com you would setup a CNAME for foo.

### DynDNS + CNAME (Strato)

So how do we now allow browsers to find our Pi in the web? We setup a DNS record for the IP that we got from MyFritz or our provider. If we get a IP from the provider however, it can change. So we need to inform the nameservers about the
change, which is the dynamic part in DynDNS.

I initially tried using DynDNS with Strato, but the propagation was excruciatingly slow, the UI was horrible and in the end
I could not really pinpoint why some CNAME records didn't work for me, but I assume the error was somewhere on my end.

If you still want to set it up with your hoster using DynDNS, here is how.

<Image src="/images/blog/2024-03-17/strato_dns_settings.png" alt="Strato DynDNS Settings" width={600} height={500} />

- Get a DynDNS password from your hoster and enable DynDNS there.
- Activate 'Use DynDNS' on the router.
- Set the DynDNS provider to Custom.
- Enter the Update-URL `https://<username>:<passwd>@dyndns.strato.com/nic/update?hostname=<domain>&myip=<ipaddr>,<ip6addr>` and other details provided by Strato.
- Do not fill in the user/password/... into theurl, instead use the respective inputs.

<Image src="/images/blog/2024-03-17/fritzbox_dyndns.png" alt="FritzBox DynDNS Setup" width={600} height={500} />

In my hosters UI, I was then able to see the status of DynDNS as IPv4: logged in / IPv6: logged in.

### Cloudflare DNS

With MyFritz! and cloudflare, the setup was also quite easy:

<Image src="/images/blog/2024-03-17/fritzbox_myfritz.png" alt="MyFritz Enabled" width={600} height={500} />

First, I went to my router's configuration page and copied the IPv4 and IPv6 that MyFritz!
provides to reach my Fritz!Box from the web.

With that, I set up a Cloudflare Account and did the auto-setup for my domain (as I already
had a setup with Strato). However that only worked partially, so I removed all auto-generated
domain settings again and added:

- A and AAAA entries for the IPs that I copied before.
- CNAME records for all subdomains (and one for www.) that I wanted to add

<Image src="/images/blog/2024-03-17/cloudflare_dns_setup.png" alt="Cloudflare DNS Settings" width={800} height={500} />

with the domain records setup, I went back to Strato to set the DNS config to use
an external DNS and put in the two URLs that Cloudflare provided.

Finally, I also set the SSL/TLS setting to 'Full' and set the 'Development mode' to
prepare for the next steps of this tutorial: The deployment of the actual services.

### Testing

With everything set up and after waiting for the new DNS records to propagate, I
sucessfully tested if I can ping my domain and if I can ssh into the IP that the ping
returned.

```bash
ping fwindolf.dev
```

```bash
ssh <ip> -i /home/flo/.ssh/pi/id_ed25519
```

After the successful test, it's time to move on to the next part: [The setup of dokku](2024-03-18-dokku-introduction)
