# Type Matching (Python 3.10)

## Introduction

Python 3.10 brought a sweet new feature to the table: pattern matching.
Similar to what you might find in languages like Scala or Rust, this addition empowers
us to write more readable and efficient code.

Let's delve into how we can use this feature in our little example bakery,
matching various baked goodies and their attributes.

Assume we have an enum representing our bakery's specialties:

```python
from enum import Enum

class Pastry(Enum):
    CROISSANT = 1
    DANISH = 2
    MUFFIN = 3
    SCONES = 4
```

## Pattern Matching

### Simple Value Matching

Let's find out how to distinguish between the different types of pastries in an
elegant way.

```python
def handle_pastry(pastry):
    match pastry:
        case Pastry.CROISSANT:
            print("Buttery and flaky!")
        case Pastry.DANISH:
            print("Sweet and fruity!")
        case Pastry.MUFFIN:
            print("Perfect for coffee!")
        case Pastry.SCONES:
            print("Excellent with tea!")
        case _:
            print("That's not on the menu!")

```

This is the standard case we've all been using for quite some time when if-else clauses
are not enough. With pattern matching, we can easily respond to each value with an
appropriate comment about our baked goods.

### Matching a Tuple

Assume our bakery groups items in a tuple, like a breakfast offer with pastry and
beverage, we can match it as follows:

```python
def breakfast_service(pastry, beverage):
    match pastry, beverage:
        case Pastry.CROISSANT, 'Coffee':
            print("OFFER: Croissant with coffee, a timeless classic!")
        case Pastry.SCONES, 'Tea':
            print("OFFER: Scones with tea, delightful!")
        case _:
            print("That's not an offer!")
```

### Matching One of Multiple Options

But that's not enough, sometimes we also allow multiple options for a pastry:

```python
def breakfast_service(pastry, beverage):
    match pastry, beverage:
        case Pastry.CROISSANT, 'Coffee':
            print("OFFER: Croissant with coffee, a timeless classic!")
        case Pastry.SCONES | Pastry.DANISH, 'Tea':
            print(f"OFFER: {pastry}, delightful!")
        case _:
            print("That's not an offer!")
```

### Wildcard Matches

We can also use a wildcard to catch any case not specifically covered:


```python
def breakfast_service(pastry, beverage):
    match pastry, beverage:
        case _, 'Coffee':
            print(f"OFFER: {pastry}, and a coffee on top!")
        case Pastry.SCONES | Pastry.DANISH, 'Tea':
            print(f"OFFER: {pastry}, delightful!")
        case _:
            print("That's not an offer!")
```

### Variable Matches

Imagine a patron can order a variable number of muffins:

```python
def muffin_order(order):
    match order:
        case []:
            print("No muffins ordered.")
        case [Pastry.MUFFIN]:
            print("One muffin coming right up!")
        case [Pastry.MUFFIN, *rest]:
            print(f"{len(rest)+1} muffins on the way!")
```

This allows us to match against a variable number of muffins, and we can even use the
rest variable to get the number of muffins ordered. Note that the rest does not
necessarily have to be only muffins, it can be any other pastry as well.

### Matching Variable Options

When dealing with more varied options, such as mixed orders:

```python
def mixed_order(order):
    match order:
        case [Pastry.CROISSANT, *rest]:
            print(f"A croissant and {len(rest)} other items.")
        case [Pastry.MUFFIN, Pastry.MUFFIN, *rest]:
            print(f"Two muffins and {len(rest)} other items.")
```

What's interesting here is that we can match against a variable number of items, but
also match against specific items in the order. The `rest` variable will contain the
rest of the items in the order.

### Capturing the Match

In the example above, we already used implicit capturing of the rest of items in the
order. Sometimes you need to capture the matched object explicitly:

```python
def capture_item(item):
    match item:
        case (Pastry.CROISSANT | Pastry.SCONES | Pastry.DANISH) as pastry:
            print(f"Preparing a fresh {pastry.name}!")
        case _:
            print("That's not a Crossaint, Scones or Danish pastry!")
```

This is especially helpful if you have a number of choices for different types.

### Adding Conditions

We can also apply conditions to our matches:

```python
def decorated_pastry(item, decoration):
    match item, decoration:
        case Pastry.MUFFIN, decoration if "frosting" in decoration.lower():
            print("A muffin with frosting, coming up!")
        case Pastry.MUFFIN, decoration:
            print("A muffin with a cherry on top, coming up!")
        case Pastry.DANISH, _ if decoration is not None:
            print("We don't decorate our danish pastry!")
```

Making use of conditions can help us match against really complex patterns, and I've
been using it to rewrite and simplify a lot of if/else chains inside the case blocks
in my code.

### Class Matching With Attributes

When dealing with specific class instances, case matching is also possible on the
attributes of the classes. Let's assume we have a Cake class:

```python
class Cake:
    def __init__(self, flavor, icing):
        self.flavor = flavor
        self.icing = icing

def cake_order(cake):
    match cake:
        case Cake(flavor="Chocolate", icing="Ganache"):
            print("A chocolate cake with ganache, delicious!")
        case Cake(flavor="Vanilla") if case.icing is not None:
            print(f"A vanilla cake with {cake.icing}, delightful!")
        case Cake(flavor="Vanilla"):
            print("A vanilla cake, delightful!")
```

The match will be successful if the attributes of the class instance match the
attributes in the case statement. This is especially useful when dealing with
classes where some attribute describes the mode of operation, and others are used
to describe the state of the object.

###  Matching Dictionaries

This way of matching also works with builtins like a dictionary:

```python
def online_order(order):
    match order:
        case {"item": "Cookie", "quantity": q} if q > 12:
            print(f"A bulk order of {q} cookies!")
        case {"item": "Cookie", "quantity": _}:
            print("Cookies, the classic treat!")
```

### Type Matching

Finally, we can check the type of object we're dealing with. This is where our bakery
example breaks a bit, but I think it's nice to see how a simple type matching would
look like, so you don't have to match `type(item)`.

```python
def type_check(item):
    match item:
        case int():
            print("We don't sell integers!")
        case str():
            print("We sell pastries, not strings!")
        case Pastry():
            print("That smells delicious!")
```

This looks a bit weird at first glance, but if you think about class/builtin type based
matching, it makes sense. The str() builtin is a class, and we can match against it
just like we would match against a class instance, but without the constraint on the
content (kind of like `str(_)`).


## Summary

Pattern matching in Python 3.10 is a really powerful tool to simplify
complicated if-else chains and improve code clarity.

You can match
- Values
- Tuples, Lists, Dicts based on their content
- Classes based on their attributes
- Types

and do a lot of crazy stuff like if clauses and aliases for matches.

I hope you can apply those examples to your own code, and simplify it as well - not only
if you're dealing with baked goods. As Python continues to evolve, we can expect
even more elegant solutions baked right into the language.
